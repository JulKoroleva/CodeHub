Welcome to CodeHub! It's a mini-site that provides a convenient environment for writing and saving your code right in your browser. Here's a quick overview of the main features:

## Key Features
1. **Create files and folders**
Create your own project structure, add files and organize them in folders. Just click on the "Create File" or "Create Folder" button, enter a name and start writing your code.

2. **Code editor**
You can write code in various programming languages, and the editor will provide syntax highlighting to make your code easier to read.

3. **File management**
Easily manage your files and folders. You can rename and delete them.

4. **Comment the code**
When you open a file, a button appears on the right; when you click on it, a block with comments pops up. In the future, this function will be useful when the project is connected to the server and a social network model for collaborative coding is implemented. Now it's just a general pool of comments.

5. **Download the project**
Once you're done with your code, you can download your files. This is useful if you need to share your code or continue working on a project locally.

## Usage
 **Create a file or folder:** Use the "Create File" and "Create Folder" buttons to get started.
**Edit the code:** Click on the file to open it in the editor and start writing your code.
**Manage files:** rename files and folders by double-clicking on them, delete using a special button.
**Download files:** When finished, click "Download file" to save your code to your computer.
